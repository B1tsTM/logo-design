#About the project

It's a project allowing users to publish design contests and letting designers upload their work. This site is similar to 99designs.com, except it's localized, narrowed down for local business needs and uses modern technologies (MEAN stack with AngularJS 2). It was designed with UML diagrams and built from scratch, considering various security issues and data flow approaches.

Development version is accessible at https://dizaino-konkursai.herokuapp.com/
